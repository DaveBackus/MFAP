I'll focus as usual on the big picture, which here involves dynamics.
For each topic/result/concept, I recommend you construct a numerical example or two to
remind yourself how it works.


\section{Stochastic processes}

The term for the combination of dynamics and randomness is {\it stochastic process\/}.
It's common to characterize them by their one-period conditional distribution:
the distribution over outcomes next period given
some description of the current situation, which we refer to as the {\it state\/}.

The simplest example is a tree.
A state in this case is a node in the tree.
The conditional distribution consists of probabilities of each of the branches
that stem from the node.
We construct probabilities of longer paths by multiplying the probabilities of individual branches.

Trees are easy to describe but cumbersome to use;
generally we want more structure than this.
We proposed stochastic processes with three properties:
(i)~Markov
